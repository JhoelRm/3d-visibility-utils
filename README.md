# 3D Visibility Utilities

Small utilities focused on visibility state control in 3D software.

## Overview

This repository contains simple visibility state utilities currently
implemented for Cinema 4D using the Python SDK.

The goal is to provide minimal, clean examples that demonstrate how
visibility states can be controlled programmatically in a 3D environment.

## Contents

- Visibility On
- Visibility Off
- Visibility Default (inherit)

Each utility is implemented as a minimal registered tool for Cinema 4D.

## Usage

These tools are intended as lightweight helpers and reference
implementations. Refer to the source code for details on how
visibility states are handled internally.
